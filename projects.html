                        <p class="project_description">
        Mathgenerator is a python package that generates a wide variety 
of math problems with customizable results. I promoted the project and 
have had 64 other people make contributions to it. Through this project,
 I learned how to make and maintain a large-scale codebase. I learned 
about testing through Github Actions and managing issues and pull 
requests on Github.

        <p class="project_description">
        Ghlog is a command line tool to write log, journals, or notes to
 a github repo from your command line. Learned how to design a command 
line interface and work with APIs.

        <p class="project_description">
        Todarith.ml is the website that I created to host mathgenerator 
and eventually, use machine learning to create, sort, and teach math 
problems. With this I created a Postgresql database to store math 
problems in. The database currently has about 1.5 million problems, 
almost entirely generated with mathgenerator. Learned a ton through this
 project including: web hosting and server deployment, databases, 
Flask(python web framework), front end development.

        <p class="project_description">
        A command line tool and python package that can take in a video 
recording of a slideshow and produce a pdf of the slides presented. 
Inspired by watching code conference presentations on Youtube that were 
just people reading information off of slides and wanting the slides 
rather than just a video. Built an accopanying website where users can 
upload their videos and download the resulting slides. Learned image 
processing and Pillow.

        <p class="project_description">
        A website I built with a couple of friends at Hyland Hackathon 
2020. Social media type site focused on saving the earth. Didnâ€™t know 
how to write and deploy a website before this so I learned Flask and the
 basics of web development the week before.
